# Cryptocurrency-Wallet

## Goals
`fintech_finder.py`: the code associated with the web interface of the application.
`crypto_wallet.py`: the Ethereum transaction functions. `crypto_wallet.py` Python scripts are integrated into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the `fintech_finder.py` file.

### Integrating these two files will allow you to automate the tasks associated with...
* generating a digital wallet
* accessing Ethereum account balances
* signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain, Ganache.

### Assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:
* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.
* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.
* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.
* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.
* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

Once you receive the transactionâ€™s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details.
